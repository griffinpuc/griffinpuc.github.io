# Meaning of Life
Concering Camus, Sartre, and Wolf
<br/>

## Section One: Camus & Sisyphus

### The myth of Sisyphus: Parallel & Different to our lives:
- **Sisyphus myth:** He is condemned to roll rock up mountain all day long, but it rolls
  back down to the bottom once he reaches the top. Punishment from the gods for his crimes.
  - A metaphor for modern lives spent working in futile jobs
- "*No sun without shadow, it is essential to know the night*"
  - This means it is crucial to accept an irrational/absurd suffering as part of the
    human experience

### Why is Sisyphus an absurd hero?:
- Lives life to the fullest
- Hates death
- Condemned to a meaningless death

### Hour of consciousness:
- Occurs when the rock rolls back down
- "*Teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks*"

### How can he take control of his fate?:
- During the hour of consciousness he is superior to his fate
- Supports his fidelity- one can imagine him happy
- "*The struggle to the heights itself is enough to fill a [persons] heart*"

<br/>

## Section Two: Existentialism

### Criticism's of existentialism:
- Encourages quietism
- Neglects charm and beauty
- Pure subjectivity
- Denies reality & seriousness of human affairs
  - Existence is an objective value

### Why wisdom of the people is sad:
- Don't question authority
- Action against tradition is doomed to fail
- Restrictive, etc.

### Existentialism is optimistic yet alarming:
- Confronts man with the possibility of choice
- Sometimes this large, open-ended choice can be alarming and overwhelming

### Existence preceedes essence:
- Existence comes first, it is up to man to decide and define their fate
- Only applied to humanity:
  - An object's essence preceedes it's existence
  - You fabricate an object because you need it, essence is first in this case

<br/>

## Section Three: Wolf's Philosophy

Distinguushing having a meaningful life vs the meaning of life

### Egoistic vs dualistic models of motivation:
- **Egoistic:**
  - Improving your own life
  - Looking out for oneself
- **Dualistic:**
  - Value to doing good for others
  - Beyond just yourself
- **Reaons of love:**
  - Applies to people and activities
  - But only some things are worthy of love

### Three criteria for a meaningful life:
- If you care deeply about something or someone
- These things must not be worthless
- Actively pursue/support the thing/person you love

### Two cliches about a meaningful life:
- Do what you love
- Be part of something bigger than yourself
