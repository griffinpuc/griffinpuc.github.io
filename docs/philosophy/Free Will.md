# Free Will

<br/>

**Free will positions:**
|                 | Free will | No free will          |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Deterministic**   | Frankfurt | d'Holbach             |
| **Indeterministic** | Chisholm  | Discussed by Chisholm |

<br/>

## Section One: D'Holbach

### Souls relationship to the body:
- Soul is either nothing more than body, or governed by same laws (nature's laws)
- If soul is governed by nature's laws then every action is done out of necessity
  - Then there is no true free action

### Man's life is a line:
- Commands man to describe upon the earth without being able to swerve (from the line) for even an instant

### Aspects out of our control:
- Birth
- Organization
- Ideas
- Habits

### What motivates the idea of free will?
- Religion & society
  - Only if we are free agents does it make sense to reward/punish
- Human vanity
  - We want to believe that we are better than animals & other humans

### Deliberation & Why choice does not equal free will:
- To be free, everything would have to lose its essence, stop feeling pleasure and pain
  - Would have to be completely indifferent
  - This would be unnatural and we would act completely different
- Even when we deliberate we arent free
  - Opposite motives act on us and we choose what is to our advantage

<br/>

## Section Two: Chisholm

### Chisholm's example:
- If an act has no cause at all (completely random), then it would not 
  make sense to hold the agent morally responsible
- If it was caused by something outside of the agent's control (prior event),
  then it would not make sense to hold them responsible

### How can we be responsible agents?:
- If an agent alone causes the act
  - No further cause
  - Would be a prime mover
  - Unmoved movers
- Related to Aquinas's argument
  - Primary and secondary movers

### Event causation vs agent causation:
- **Event (transeunt) causation** > Events that are caused by other events
- **Agent (immanuent) causation** > Agent itself is the cause, starts a chain of events

### Relevance of Artistotle's quote:
- "*A staff moves a stone, and is moved by a hand, which is moved by a man.*"
- Fits the discussion of transient and imminent causation

### Influence of prior events:
- Chisholm: Beliefs and desires "*incline but do not necessitate action*"

<br/>

## Section Three: Frankfurt

### What is special about persons?:
- Significant aspect of a person is structure of the will

### First & second order desires:
- **First order:**
  - Animals can have desires, motives, make choices, and deliberate
  - **Two types of desires:**
    - *A* could prefer to do *Y*, or another desire could motivate
    - The desire to *X* motivates *A* to act
      - *A* wants to *X* identifies as the will
- **Second order:**
  - Wanting to want something
  - Only humans can posses this desire
  - **Two types of desires:**
    - *A* wants to experience the desire for *X*, but doesnt want the desire to be effective
    - *A* wants the desire for *X* to be effective
      - An essential feature of a person

### Unwilling addict vs wanton addict:
- **Unwilling addict:**
  - Wants drug/to take drug
  - Wants to want to not take drug
- **Wanton addict:**
  - Wants drug (or not)
  - Doesnt care which desire is effective

### Frankfurt free will & free action:
- Free will is not doing what you want
  - That is freedom of action
  - Many animals can also posses this, it is non-distinctive
- Free will is wanting what you want

### Why this is compatible with determinism:
- Even if first and second order desires are completelty necessitated by prior events, you can still
  have free will as long as desires of first and second order volitions line up
