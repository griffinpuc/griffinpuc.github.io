# Consciousness
Concerning Descartes, Churchland, and Chalmers
add more here

<br/>

## Section One: Different Theories

### Monism vs dualism:
  - **Dualism** > mind can exist seperatly
  - **Monism** > mind & body is one

### Dualist theory:
  - **Interactionism** > mind & body interact and affect one another
  - **Epiphenomenalism** > mental events are caused by physical events in the brain
  - **Parallelism** > mental and bodily events are perfectly coordinated, without any causal interaction

### Monist theory:
  - **Eliminative materialism** > there are no minds (mental properties), just physical bodies
  - **Idealism** > Reality is fundamentally mental

### Other theory:
  - **Property dualism** > Within body there are both physical and conscious experiential properties
  - **Reductive materialisim** > Only the menterial world (matter) is truly real

<br/>

## Section Two: Descartes (Substance Dualism)

### Goal of meditation II:
- Tries to clarify what this *"I"* is, this *"thing that thinks"*

### What is he certain of?
- He decides he can be certain that he exists
  - *"I think therefore I am"*
  - He is a thing that thinks, knowing he has thoughts
- Certain in his belief in God

### The wax argument:
- Examine the physical properties of a ball of wax
- Place it near the fire, sensible qualities change, yet it is still the same piece of wax
- Infinite forms that the wax could take, and one cannot possibly imagine them all
- This must mean that the wax is known by means of intellect alone

<br/>

## Section three: Churchland

### Folk psychology:
- Everyday way of referring to beliefs, desires, feelings, etc. (Propositional attitudes, towards a statement)

### Why is it just a theory?:
- Cannot explain many central and important phenomena
  - E.g. how we sleep, think, learn, etc.
- Has been around for centuries, and no progess has been made
  - Although is this a drawback? Is it possible that it is correct?

### What should it be replaced by?:
- Should be replaced by neuroscience
- Eliminate the mental with material/physical brain

<br/>

## Section Four: Chalmers

### Easy vs. hard problems/questions:
- **Hard questions:**
  - They are hard as it is difficult to explain in terms of functions/neural mechanics because they can occur without any conscious experience (E.i. in the dark)
  - **Example** > How do we discriminize, categorize, and react to stimuli?
- **Easy questions:**
  - They are easy because we can imagine how we would go about answering them
  - **Example** > Why do we have any conscious experience at all?

### Dual-aspect theory of information:
- Information has a physical property and an experiential property
- Anything that processes information has some level of consciousness or an experience like it
